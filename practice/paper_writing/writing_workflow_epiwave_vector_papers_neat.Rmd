## Purpose

Notes from the discussions focused on **paper‑writing strategy**, **journal targeting**, **collaboration workflow**, and a few **technical/debugging** takeaways.

## What’s New (Highlights)

-   **Where to state the ‘what’s new’ claim:** Put a clear, single‑sentence novelty/USP in (1) the **title or running tagline**, (2) the **abstract**, and (3) the **cover letter to the editor**; optionally (4) emphasize again in the **intro conclusion** (last paragraph) as the problem–gap–contribution pivot.
-   **Tailor the message to the audience:** For **methods** audiences, emphasize modelling innovation; for **public‑health** audiences, foreground policy‑relevant outputs (e.g., percent of resistance attributable to mechanism X; implications for vector control). The same analysis can be framed differently for different journals and readers.
-   **Two‑paper strategy when scope is big:** (A) **method paper** (introduces the model and validation), and (B) **application paper** (country‑specific data integration, results, and maps). This reaches distinct audiences and keeps each manuscript focused.
-   **Introduction structure = funnel:** Start from the broader problem → narrow to the specific gap → end with the clear, one‑sentence contribution; avoid generic biology background that isn’t needed for your argument.
-   **Citations etiquette:** Cite **primary sources** for results; use **reviews** only for synthesized claims; avoid out‑of‑date citations; mine the **citing network** to find newer work; never paraphrase another paper’s intro as your own.
-   **Results‑first planning:** Draft a **figure/table list** (the “paper skeleton”) early; write provisional **captions** and key findings before full analysis to drive the pipeline.
-   **Collaboration tooling:** **Overleaf/LaTeX** excels for math‑heavy teams; **Google Docs/Word** are fine for iterative comments (typical for PhD lead writing); **Quarto/R Markdown** inside a repo is possible but heavier for collaborators not on Git/GitHub.

## Journal Targeting (Guidance)

-   **Public‑health / malaria journals:** Prioritize **impact on control decisions**, clarity of **maps/uncertainty**, and **practical metrics**.
-   **Methodological / computational biology venues:** Center the **novel model**, **validation**, and **generalizability**.
-   **High‑profile general journals:** Only when the **method is new *and* the application reveals a surprising result**; otherwise split method & application across suitable outlets.

## Writing the Introduction – Practical Template

1.  **Problem context** (malaria control impact; why vectors/resistance matter).
2.  **Specific threat or focus** (e.g., new vector, spread, urban/rural differences).
3.  **What has been tried** (correlative SDMs, mechanistic SDMs, hybrids) → **their limitations** in this setting.
4.  **Gap** (why existing work is insufficient for your objective).
5.  **Our contribution in one sentence** (the clear “what’s new” statement).

> **Tip:** Write the intro **without citations first** (to keep logic yours). Then add references to support each statement; use reviews sparingly, and prefer **primary** up‑to‑date papers.

## Novelty/USP – Examples (for inspiration)

-   “**First national‑scale maps** of [X] resistance mechanisms for **[Country/Year]** using [data fusion of entomology + surveillance].”
-   “**Updated distribution maps** for **[Species]** reflecting **[Year–Year]** expansion with bias‑adjusted reporting and spread dynamics.”
-   “A **mechanistic–spatial** framework that integrates **vector data** to produce **decision‑ready FOI** surfaces and **uncertainty**.”

## Collaboration & Versioning

-   **PhD lead writing:** You own the primary text; supervisors provide iterative comments (Doc/Word track‑changes is fine).
-   **Math‑heavy manuscripts:** Overleaf/LaTeX if many equations; otherwise Markdown/Quarto is optional.
-   **Project management:** Maintain a **paper skeleton** (sections, figure list, TODOs); GitHub issues can track figures/analyses to produce.

## Action Items

| Item | Notes |
|----|----|
| Draft single‑sentence novelty/USP for current paper | Reuse in title/abstract/cover letter/intro‑close |
| Build paper skeleton (section bullets, figure list, captions) | Drives analysis pipeline & coding backlog |
| Decide journal track (method vs application; PH vs methods) | Split into two manuscripts if scope is large |
| Refresh citations (primary & recent; citing‑network search) | Replace dated refs; add key reviews only |
| Data joins & renames audit | Ensure correct `rename()` direction and keys exist |

## Appendix – Reusable Snippets

### Cover‑letter hook (1–2 sentences)

> “This manuscript provides the *first* decision‑ready maps of **[X]** for **[Country/Year]**, integrating entomological surveillance with a mechanistic spatial model. Results directly inform **[intervention choice/targeting]** and quantify **[uncertainty/impact]**.”

### Abstract ‘what’s new’ (1 sentence)

> “We present **[new method/application]** that **[addresses limitation]**, producing **[key output]** that improves **[policy/operational decision]**.”

### Intro last line (gap → contribution)

> “To address this gap, we develop **[method]** and apply it to **[setting]**, yielding **[maps/metrics]** that support **[decision]**.”

## Paper Skeleton (updated example)

### Letter to the Editor

-   One‑sentence novelty/USP (tailored to journal scope).
-   Why this journal: fit to audience/scope; relevance to malaria/vector control.
-   2–4 suggested reviewers; 1–2 opposed reviewers (if any) with rationale.
-   Disclosures: conflicts of interest; preprint status (if applicable).

### Abstract (Structured)

-   **Background:** 1–2 sentences of problem context and gap.
-   **Methods:** High‑level summary (data sources; mechanistic + spatial/Bayesian modelling).
-   **Results:** Key quantitative findings and uncertainty.
-   **Conclusion/Implications:** What this enables for decision‑making.
-   Include the one‑sentence **“what’s new”** line explicitly.

### Introduction

-   Problem context and burden; why vectors/resistance matter now.
-   Specific focus (geography/species/period); define objective clearly.
-   What has been tried (SDMs, mechanistic SDMs, hybrids) → key limitations in this setting.
-   The gap this paper addresses.
-   Our contribution (single, crisp sentence): what is new, to whom it matters, and why.

### Methods

-   **Study area & period.**
-   **Data:** Entomology/vector, epidemiology/cases, environmental covariates; inclusion/exclusion.
-   **Pre‑processing:** Harmonization, QA/QC, bias correction, temporal alignment.
-   **Model overview:** Mechanistic transmission block (Ross–Macdonald/FOI), spatial covariates for *m*, GP residuals.
-   **Inference & priors:** Hierarchical structure, priors/constraints, computation.
-   **Validation & performance:** Cross‑validation, hold‑outs, predictive checks.
-   **Sensitivity & robustness:** Parameter sweeps, scenario analyses.
-   **Software & reproducibility:** Code repo, versioning, packages; data‑use agreements.

### Results

-   **Descriptives:** Data coverage and summary statistics.
-   **Main figures (indicative):**
    -   **Map 1:** National FOI surface with uncertainty banding.
    -   **Figure 2:** Covariate effect sizes (posterior summaries).
    -   **Figure 3:** Intervention scenarios (before/after deltas).
-   **Secondary outputs:** Validation tables/metrics; robustness checks.

### Discussion

-   Recap: what we did, why it is new/important, and top‑line findings.
-   Interpretation vs literature: how this compares/extends.
-   Policy implications: how maps/metrics inform targeting and timing.
