# Executive Summary

This meeting aligned the **EpiWave FOI** programme on three fronts: (1)
make the **Ross–Macdonald (RM)** core fast and robust under **African
seasonality**; (2) elevate **vector-informed parameterisation** for $M$
(abundance), $A$ (biting rate), and $g$ (mosquito death rate); and (3)
stage a **small spatial case study for Tanzania** that connects FOI to
incidence, validating with entomological and surveillance data. We will
**hold** $B, C, r$ fixed in v1 to keep scope tractable and focus the
novelty on vector integration ($M, A, g$).

# Decisions & Rationale

## D1. Prioritise time-varying $M, A, g$; hold $B, C, r$ fixed in v1

-   **Why:** Biggest epidemiological leverage and closest link to vector
    data and interventions; $B, C$ are weakly varying, $r$ ties more to
    case management than vector control.
-   **Implication:** Novelty is concentrated where we have data and
    mechanistic priors (Vector Atlas, MosquitoDB, ITN/IRS evidence).

## D2. Stress-test ODE solvers against “hard” African seasonality

-   **Why:** Numerical stability and speed are critical for
    national-scale mapping. Hard cases = **bimodal peaks** (e.g.,
    Uganda-like) and **long dry/short intense wet** spikes (southern
    Africa-like).
-   **Implication:** Choose solver & step-control that remain accurate
    for sharp transitions while being GPU/auto-diff friendly for
    inference.

## D3. Intervention effects enter via multiplicative modifiers on $M, A, g$

-   **Why:** Matches experimental hut trial (EHT) evidence that
    **mortality, deterrence, and blood-feeding inhibition** change with
    resistance and product class.
-   **Implication:** Start simple (one or two parameters per pathway)
    and expand complexity later as data allow.

# Model Architecture (v1)

## 1) Transmission core (Ross–Macdonald)

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = m(t, s)\,a(t, s)\,b\,z\,(1-x) - r\,x, \qquad
\frac{dz}{dt} = a(t, s)\,c\,x\,(1-z) - g(t, s)\,z,
$$

where $x$ = human infectious fraction, $z$ = infectious mosquito
fraction, and $s$ indexes **site/pixel**. **FOI**: $$
\xi(t,s) = m(t,s)\,a(t,s)\,b\,z(t,s).
$$

We treat $b, c, r$ as constants in v1.

## 2) Supports (parameter domains)

-   $m>0$; unbounded above.\
-   $a \in (0,1]$\*\* (first-bite convention for v1; can relax later).\
-   $g>0$ (instantaneous death rate).

## 3) Data-informed priors & covariate links

### 3.1 Mosquito abundance $m(t,s)$

Baseline **vector-model** surface $m^\*_{t,s}$ (e.g., Vector Atlas/Jerry
model/HLC-derived) with intervention & climate covariates
$X^{(m)}_{t,s}$: $$
m_{t,s} = m^\*_{t,s} \; \exp\!\big(X^{(m)}_{t,s}\,\beta_m\big)\; f_{\text{net}}^{(m)}(\text{ITN}_{t,s}, \rho_{\text{res}}, \text{use}_{t,s})\; f_{\text{IRS}}^{(m)}(\cdot).
$$

> **Minimal v1**: one **net-use** term and one **resistance modifier**
> suffices; add IRS later if in scope.

### 3.2 Biting rate $a(t,s)$

Start with constant baseline $a_0$, reduced by nets
(contact/repellency/feeding inhibition): $$
a_{t,s} = a_0\; f_{\text{net}}^{(a)}(\text{ITN}_{t,s}, \rho_{\text{res}}, \text{use}_{t,s}).
$$

### 3.3 Death rate $g(t,s)$

From survival probability $S_{\Delta t}(t,s)$ over $\Delta t$ (e.g.,
daily): $$
g_{t,s} = -\frac{1}{\Delta t}\ln S_{\Delta t}(t,s) = g^\*_{t,s} \; f_{\text{net}}^{(g)}(\text{ITN}_{t,s}, \rho_{\text{res}}, \text{use}_{t,s})\; f_{\text{IRS}}^{(g)}(\cdot).
$$

> **Note:** $g^\*_{t,s}$ from **microclimate survival** (temperature,
> humidity); then modify with interventions.

## 4) Linking to EHT evidence (for $f_{\text{net}}$)

Let **bioassay survival** $\theta_B$ be the resistance index and **EHT
survival** $\theta_H$ the net-induced survival in huts. Empirical
relationships show: - As **resistance rises**, net-induced **mortality
declines**, **deterrence falls**, and **successful blood-feeding
increases**. - Differences by **hut design** (East vs West) suggest
caution when translating to community settings.

We use a **monotone mapping** (logistic or log-logistic)
$\theta_H = f(\theta_B; \alpha, \beta)$ and then allocate effects to the
three pathways: - **Mortality uplift** → $f_{\text{net}}^{(g)}$\
- **Biting/contact reduction** → $f_{\text{net}}^{(a)}$\
- **Abundance/entry deterrence** → $f_{\text{net}}^{(m)}$

# Numerical Strategy

1.  **Stress-set**: synthetic seasonality forcing with (i) **bimodal**
    peaks and (ii) **long dry + sharp wet** spike.\
2.  **Benchmark**: fixed tolerances; compare explicit vs. adaptive
    solvers (auto-diff friendly).\
3.  **Accept** solver if (i) preserves positivity/units, (ii) stable for
    sharp transitions, (iii) meets wall-time budget for pixel-level
    runs.

# Validation Plan

-   **Internal**: state trajectory checks; FOI–incidence consistency
    under known special cases.\
-   **External**: site-level comparison of predicted **mortality**,
    **blood-feeding inhibition**, and **deterrence** against EHT-derived
    summaries where available; compare incidence fits vs. routine data.

# Tanzania v1 Case Study (scaffold)

1.  **Sites**: select 2–3 contrasting districts (bimodal vs unimodal
    seasonality).\
2.  **Inputs**: vector abundance/survival surfaces, ITN coverage & type,
    bioassay resistance, rainfall/temperature.\
3.  **Outputs**: maps of $m, a, g$, seasonal **FOI**, predicted
    incidence.\
4.  **Checks**: sensitivity to resistance; counterfactual without nets.

# Action Items

| ID | Task | Owner | Notes | Due |

# Open Questions / Risks

-   Partitioning **net effects** across $m, a, g$ is **non-unique**;
    identify minimal set that reproduces EHT patterns.\
-   **Hut-design bias** in EHTs may inflate/deflate pathways;
    triangulate with additional field data where possible.\
-   Balance between **model richness** and **identifiability** in a
    spatial Bayesian setting.

# Appendix A — Ross–Macdonald & FOI (for reference)
